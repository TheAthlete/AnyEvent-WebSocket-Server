- xt/js/browser.html: finish each test case with client's ws.close().
  Currently this is not easy because the client won't close the TCP
  connection immediately after ws.close().

- Add "timeout" feature. The timeout is set between the TCP connection
  establishment and the complete of receiving WebSocket request. The
  timeout is the defence against the slow-request attack. However that
  kind of feature should be covered by the front-end Web server like
  Apache httpd or nginx, so it's not very important for this module.
